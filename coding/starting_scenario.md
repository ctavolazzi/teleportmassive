# Sam Iker Wakes Up
Sam Iker awakens from a vivid dream where he was soaring around a massive skyscraper. The feeling of freedom still lingers as he opens his eyes. 

What will he do next?
- (1) Look out the window to see the city below.
- (2) Check his phone for messages.
- (3) Get dressed and prepare to leave.
- (4) Other (say something or take an unexpected action).
