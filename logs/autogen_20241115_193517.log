The log will include timestamps, the logging level, and the message.\n\n2. **Game Title**: We define a constant `TITLE` for the game title.\n\n3. **Starting Scenario**: The `start_scenario` dictionary contains a description of the scene and a list of choices available to the player.\n\n4. **Game State**: The `game_state` dictionary holds the current state of the game, including the active scenario, character stats, location, items, and player actions.\n\n5. **Initial Logging**: Upon starting the game, we log the game title and the initial scenario description.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNext, we’ll create a function to display the scenario and handle player choices.

Let\'s start by creating the basic structure of the "Teleport Massive CYOA" text-based adventure game. We\'ll aim to keep the code clean and modular as we build it up step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Setup with Logging\n\nWe\'ll begin by setting up basic logging, defining our game title, and creating a starting scenario for Sam Iker waking from his skyscraper dream.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\n# Logging action\nlogging.info(f"Game started with title: \'{TITLE}\'")\nlogging.info(f"Initial scenario: {start_scenario[\'description\']}")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Logging Setup**: We use Python\'s logging module to enable logging for events in the game. The log will include timestamps, the logging level, and the message.\n\n2. **Game Title**: We define a constant `TITLE` for the game title.\n\n3. **Starting Scenario**: The `start_scenario` dictionary contains a description of the scene and a list of choices available to the player.\n\n4. **Game State**: The `game_state` dictionary holds the current state of the game, including the active scenario, character stats, location, items, and player actions.\n\n5. **Initial Logging**: Upon starting the game, we log the game title and the initial scenario description.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNext, we’ll create a function to display the scenario and handle player choices. We will also start organizing the use of markdown files for the scenarios.

Now that we have the basic setup and logging working, we\'ll proceed to implement a function to display the current scenario and handle player choices. This function will also incorporate the \'other\' option, allowing players to input their own unique actions.\n\n### Step 2: Display Scenario and Handle Choices\n\nWe\'ll create a function called `display_scenario` which will print the current scenario, present the choices to the player, and handle their input. Here\'s the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do? (Enter the number or write \'Other\' to specify): ")\n\n    # Handle player choice\n    if player_choice.isdigit() and 1 <= int(player_choice) <= len(scenario[\'choices\']):\n        choice_index = int(player_choice) - 1\n        selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n        logging.info(f"Player chose: {selected_choice}")\n        # Here we will handle the choice in the next step\n        return selected_choice\n    elif player_choice.strip().lower() == "other":\n        custom_action = input("You chose \'Other\'. What do you want to do? ")\n        logging.info(f"Player chose a custom action: {custom_action}")\n        return custom_action\n    else:\n        logging.warning("Invalid choice made by the player.")\n        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Function Definition (`display_scenario`)**: This function takes a scenario as input.\n\n2. **Log Scenario Display**: When the scenario is displayed, we log the action.\n\n3. **Print Scenario Description and Choices**: The function prints the scenario description and the available choices with numbers.\n\n4. **Player Input Handling**: \n   - The function checks if the user input is a valid choice (a number corresponding to one of the options).\n   - If the player inputs \'Other\', they have the chance to specify a custom action.\n   - If the input is invalid, a warning is logged, and the function recalls itself recursively to allow the player to try again.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The selected choice or custom action is returned.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe next step will be to handle the selected choice and navigate to a new scenario based on that choice.

The log will include timestamps, the logging level, and the message.\n\n2. **Game Title**: We define a constant `TITLE` for the game title.\n\n3. **Starting Scenario**: The `start_scenario` dictionary contains a description of the scene and a list of choices available to the player.\n\n4. **Game State**: The `game_state` dictionary holds the current state of the game, including the active scenario, character stats, location, items, and player actions.\n\n5. **Initial Logging**: Upon starting the game, we log the game title and the initial scenario description.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNext, we’ll create a function to display the scenario and handle player choices. We will also start organizing the use of markdown files for the scenarios. Let me know if you want to proceed with that!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': "exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Game started with title: 'Teleport Massive CYOA'\n2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Initial scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n", 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'Great! Now that we have the basic setup and logging working, we\'ll proceed to implement a function to display the current scenario and handle player choices. This function will also incorporate the \'other\' option, allowing players to input their own unique actions.\n\n### Step 2: Display Scenario and Handle Choices\n\nWe\'ll create a function called `display_scenario` which will print the current scenario, present the choices to the player, and handle their input. Here\'s the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do?

Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Function Definition (`display_scenario`)**: This function takes a scenario as input.\n\n2. **Log Scenario Display**: When the scenario is displayed, we log the action.\n\n3. **Print Scenario Description and Choices**: The function prints the scenario description and the available choices with numbers.\n\n4. **Player Input Handling**: \n   - The function checks if the user input is a valid choice (a number corresponding to one of the options).\n   - If the player inputs \'Other\', they have the chance to specify a custom action.\n   - If the input is invalid, a warning is logged, and the function recalls itself recursively to allow the player to try again.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The selected choice or custom action is returned.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe next step will be to handle the selected choice and navigate to a new scenario based on that choice.

We\'ll aim to keep the code clean and modular as we build it up step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Setup with Logging\n\nWe\'ll begin by setting up basic logging, defining our game title, and creating a starting scenario for Sam Iker waking from his skyscraper dream.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\n# Logging action\nlogging.info(f"Game started with title: \'{TITLE}\'")\nlogging.info(f"Initial scenario: {start_scenario[\'description\']}")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Logging Setup**: We use Python\'s logging module to enable logging for events in the game. The log will include timestamps, the logging level, and the message.\n\n2. **Game Title**: We define a constant `TITLE` for the game title.\n\n3. **Starting Scenario**: The `start_scenario` dictionary contains a description of the scene and a list of choices available to the player.\n\n4. **Game State**: The `game_state` dictionary holds the current state of the game, including the active scenario, character stats, location, items, and player actions.\n\n5. **Initial Logging**: Upon starting the game, we log the game title and the initial scenario description.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNext, we’ll create a function to display the scenario and handle player choices.

This function will also incorporate the \'other\' option, allowing players to input their own unique actions.\n\n### Step 2: Display Scenario and Handle Choices\n\nWe\'ll create a function called `display_scenario` which will print the current scenario, present the choices to the player, and handle their input. Here\'s the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do?

This typically involves reading the next scenario from a markdown file.

I will also integrate everything so that the game will operate seamlessly from start to finish, giving us a clearer structure. \n\n### Complete Code Structure\n\nHere’s the revised code, which includes everything defined correctly from the start scenario to displaying choices:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do? (Enter the number or write \'Other\' to specify): ")\n\n    # Handle player choice\n    if player_choice.isdigit() and 1 <= int(player_choice) <= len(scenario[\'choices\']):\n        choice_index = int(player_choice) - 1\n        selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n        logging.info(f"Player chose: {selected_choice}")\n        return selected_choice\n    elif player_choice.strip().lower() == "other":\n        custom_action = input("You chose \'Other\'. What do you want to do? ")\n        logging.info(f"Player chose a custom action: {custom_action}")\n        return custom_action\n    else:\n        logging.warning("Invalid choice made by the player.")\n        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n```\n\n### Key Points\n1. **Organization**: All key components, such as the logging setup, game title, and the starting scenario, are defined in the same code block, ensuring everything is in scope when the program is executed.\n\n2. **Scenario Presentation**: The `display_scenario` function is called at the end, allowing for both the display of information and the capture of player input.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow that the game can display scenarios and accept player input, the next steps are:\n- To define a new scenario based upon choices made.\n- To save scenarios in markdown format and read them into the game.\n\nLet me know if you would like to proceed along this path!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 124 (execution failed)\nCode output: \nTimeout', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'It seems that the execution encountered a timeout error, which can occur for various reasons including the environment not being able to process user inputs properly. To move forward, let\'s refine our approach and ensure that we only break down the code into manageable parts that do not require interactive execution in a limited environment.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nLet’s set up a basic simulation of player choices without needing real-time user inputs. We can define a mock input handling system which simulates player choices while focusing on how to transition between scenarios in a more controlled way.\n\n### Step 3: Simulating Choices with Scenario Navigation\n\nLet\'s enhance the game by adding a hypothetical structure that uses markdown to represent scenarios and transitions based on player choices. This will also formally introduce the idea of handling scenarios from markdown files.\n\n1. We’ll simulate player choices using a defined sequence.\n2. We’ll include functions to read from markdown files later, but for now, we will use static definitions.\n\nHere’s a revised version of the previous code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Sample Scenarios stored within the code for this demonstration\nscenarios = {\n    "start": {\n        "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n        "choices": [\n            "explore the city streets",\n            "look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n            "find a place to eat",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "city_explore",\n            "skyscraper_search",\n            "city_eat",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_explore": {\n        "description": "Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.",\n        "choices": [\n            "talk to a street vendor",\n            "enter a neon-lit bar",\n            "sit on a bench",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "vendor_talk",\n            "bar_entry",\n            "bench_rest",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "skyscraper_search": {\n        "description": "Sam searches for a way back to the skyscraper, feeling a strong desire to fly again.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask a passerby for directions",\n            "search for a taxi",\n            "try to climb the building",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "ask_passersby",\n            "find_taxi",\n            "climb_building",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_eat": {\n        "description": "Sam finds a local diner and enjoys a meal, feeling refreshed and ready for more adventure.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask the waiter for recommendations",\n            "explore the diner further",\n            "leave a good tip",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "waiter_recommend",\n            "diner_explore",\n            "leave_tip",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": "start",\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\ndef display_scenario(scenario_key):\n    # Fetch the scenario from predefined scenarios\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\n    \n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    return scenario\n\n# Simulating player choices - this could be replaced with real input later\ndef simulate_player_choice(scenario):\n    # Just a simple strategy to choose the first option (for demonstration)\n    choice_index = 0  # Simulating the first choice\n    selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n    logging.info(f"Simulated player chose: {selected_choice}")\n    \n    # Find the next scenario based on the choice made\n    next_scenario_key = scenario[\'next_scenarios\'][choice_index]\n    return next_scenario_key\n\n# Game loop simulation\ncurrent_scenario_key = game_state["current_scenario"]\nfor _ in range(5):  # Simulate up to 5 iterations\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n    current_scenario_key = simulate_player_choice(current_scenario)\n\n# Final logging to indicate end of simulation\nlogging.info("Game simulation complete.")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Changes\n\n1. **Scenarios Defined in Code**: All possible scenarios are defined within a dictionary for easy access. In a real implementation, we could later switch this to read from markdown files.\n\n2. **Simulation of Choices**: We added the `simulate_player_choice` function, which simulates player decision-making. For simplicity, it always selects the first choice.\n\n3. **Game Loop Simulation**: We implement a simple loop to simulate several steps in the game, allowing us to see the transitions between scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\nYou can run this full code block now to see how it operates. After we confirm this is working without issues, the next logical step is to implement reading from markdown files for our scenarios, integrating a librarian function to manage the game state, and possibly defining more dynamic player actions. \n\nLet me know how you want to proceed!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: explore the city streets\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: talk to a street vendor\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 118, in <module>\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 91, in display_scenario\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\nKeyError: \'vendor_talk\'\nSam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n\nChoices:\n1. explore the city streets\n2. look for a way back to the skyscraper\n3. find a place to eat\n4. other\nSam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n\nChoices:\n1. talk to a street vendor\n2. enter a neon-lit bar\n3. sit on a bench\n4. other\n', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'stream': False}}

We\'ll aim to keep the code clean and modular as we build it up step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Setup with Logging\n\nWe\'ll begin by setting up basic logging, defining our game title, and creating a starting scenario for Sam Iker waking from his skyscraper dream.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\n# Logging action\nlogging.info(f"Game started with title: \'{TITLE}\'")\nlogging.info(f"Initial scenario: {start_scenario[\'description\']}")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Logging Setup**: We use Python\'s logging module to enable logging for events in the game. The log will include timestamps, the logging level, and the message.\n\n2. **Game Title**: We define a constant `TITLE` for the game title.\n\n3. **Starting Scenario**: The `start_scenario` dictionary contains a description of the scene and a list of choices available to the player.\n\n4. **Game State**: The `game_state` dictionary holds the current state of the game, including the active scenario, character stats, location, items, and player actions.\n\n5. **Initial Logging**: Upon starting the game, we log the game title and the initial scenario description.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNext, we’ll create a function to display the scenario and handle player choices. We will also start organizing the use of markdown files for the scenarios. Let me know if you want to proceed with that!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': "exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Game started with title: 'Teleport Massive CYOA'\n2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Initial scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n", 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'Great! Now that we have the basic setup and logging working, we\'ll proceed to implement a function to display the current scenario and handle player choices. This function will also incorporate the \'other\' option, allowing players to input their own unique actions.\n\n### Step 2: Display Scenario and Handle Choices\n\nWe\'ll create a function called `display_scenario` which will print the current scenario, present the choices to the player, and handle their input. Here\'s the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do? (Enter the number or write \'Other\' to specify): ")\n\n    # Handle player choice\n    if player_choice.isdigit() and 1 <= int(player_choice) <= len(scenario[\'choices\']):\n        choice_index = int(player_choice) - 1\n        selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n        logging.info(f"Player chose: {selected_choice}")\n        # Here we will handle the choice in the next step\n        return selected_choice\n    elif player_choice.strip().lower() == "other":\n        custom_action = input("You chose \'Other\'. What do you want to do? ")\n        logging.info(f"Player chose a custom action: {custom_action}")\n        return custom_action\n    else:\n        logging.warning("Invalid choice made by the player.")\n        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Function Definition (`display_scenario`)**: This function takes a scenario as input.\n\n2. **Log Scenario Display**: When the scenario is displayed, we log the action.\n\n3. **Print Scenario Description and Choices**: The function prints the scenario description and the available choices with numbers.\n\n4. **Player Input Handling**: \n   - The function checks if the user input is a valid choice (a number corresponding to one of the options).\n   - If the player inputs \'Other\', they have the chance to specify a custom action.\n   - If the input is invalid, a warning is logged, and the function recalls itself recursively to allow the player to try again.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The selected choice or custom action is returned.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe next step will be to handle the selected choice and navigate to a new scenario based on that choice. This typically involves reading the next scenario from a markdown file.

I will also integrate everything so that the game will operate seamlessly from start to finish, giving us a clearer structure. \n\n### Complete Code Structure\n\nHere’s the revised code, which includes everything defined correctly from the start scenario to displaying choices:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do? (Enter the number or write \'Other\' to specify): ")\n\n    # Handle player choice\n    if player_choice.isdigit() and 1 <= int(player_choice) <= len(scenario[\'choices\']):\n        choice_index = int(player_choice) - 1\n        selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n        logging.info(f"Player chose: {selected_choice}")\n        return selected_choice\n    elif player_choice.strip().lower() == "other":\n        custom_action = input("You chose \'Other\'.

Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n```\n\n### Key Points\n1. **Organization**: All key components, such as the logging setup, game title, and the starting scenario, are defined in the same code block, ensuring everything is in scope when the program is executed.\n\n2. **Scenario Presentation**: The `display_scenario` function is called at the end, allowing for both the display of information and the capture of player input.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow that the game can display scenarios and accept player input, the next steps are:\n- To define a new scenario based upon choices made.\n- To save scenarios in markdown format and read them into the game.\n\nLet me know if you would like to proceed along this path!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 124 (execution failed)\nCode output: \nTimeout', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'It seems that the execution encountered a timeout error, which can occur for various reasons including the environment not being able to process user inputs properly. To move forward, let\'s refine our approach and ensure that we only break down the code into manageable parts that do not require interactive execution in a limited environment.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nLet’s set up a basic simulation of player choices without needing real-time user inputs. We can define a mock input handling system which simulates player choices while focusing on how to transition between scenarios in a more controlled way.\n\n### Step 3: Simulating Choices with Scenario Navigation\n\nLet\'s enhance the game by adding a hypothetical structure that uses markdown to represent scenarios and transitions based on player choices. This will also formally introduce the idea of handling scenarios from markdown files.\n\n1. We’ll simulate player choices using a defined sequence.\n2. We’ll include functions to read from markdown files later, but for now, we will use static definitions.\n\nHere’s a revised version of the previous code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Sample Scenarios stored within the code for this demonstration\nscenarios = {\n    "start": {\n        "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n        "choices": [\n            "explore the city streets",\n            "look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n            "find a place to eat",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "city_explore",\n            "skyscraper_search",\n            "city_eat",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_explore": {\n        "description": "Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.",\n        "choices": [\n            "talk to a street vendor",\n            "enter a neon-lit bar",\n            "sit on a bench",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "vendor_talk",\n            "bar_entry",\n            "bench_rest",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "skyscraper_search": {\n        "description": "Sam searches for a way back to the skyscraper, feeling a strong desire to fly again.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask a passerby for directions",\n            "search for a taxi",\n            "try to climb the building",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "ask_passersby",\n            "find_taxi",\n            "climb_building",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_eat": {\n        "description": "Sam finds a local diner and enjoys a meal, feeling refreshed and ready for more adventure.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask the waiter for recommendations",\n            "explore the diner further",\n            "leave a good tip",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "waiter_recommend",\n            "diner_explore",\n            "leave_tip",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": "start",\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\ndef display_scenario(scenario_key):\n    # Fetch the scenario from predefined scenarios\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\n    \n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    return scenario\n\n# Simulating player choices - this could be replaced with real input later\ndef simulate_player_choice(scenario):\n    # Just a simple strategy to choose the first option (for demonstration)\n    choice_index = 0  # Simulating the first choice\n    selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n    logging.info(f"Simulated player chose: {selected_choice}")\n    \n    # Find the next scenario based on the choice made\n    next_scenario_key = scenario[\'next_scenarios\'][choice_index]\n    return next_scenario_key\n\n# Game loop simulation\ncurrent_scenario_key = game_state["current_scenario"]\nfor _ in range(5):  # Simulate up to 5 iterations\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n    current_scenario_key = simulate_player_choice(current_scenario)\n\n# Final logging to indicate end of simulation\nlogging.info("Game simulation complete.")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Changes\n\n1. **Scenarios Defined in Code**: All possible scenarios are defined within a dictionary for easy access. In a real implementation, we could later switch this to read from markdown files.\n\n2. **Simulation of Choices**: We added the `simulate_player_choice` function, which simulates player decision-making. For simplicity, it always selects the first choice.\n\n3. **Game Loop Simulation**: We implement a simple loop to simulate several steps in the game, allowing us to see the transitions between scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\nYou can run this full code block now to see how it operates. After we confirm this is working without issues, the next logical step is to implement reading from markdown files for our scenarios, integrating a librarian function to manage the game state, and possibly defining more dynamic player actions. \n\nLet me know how you want to proceed!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: explore the city streets\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: talk to a street vendor\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 118, in <module>\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 91, in display_scenario\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\nKeyError: \'vendor_talk\'\nSam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n\nChoices:\n1. explore the city streets\n2. look for a way back to the skyscraper\n3. find a place to eat\n4. other\nSam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n\nChoices:\n1. talk to a street vendor\n2. enter a neon-lit bar\n3. sit on a bench\n4. other\n', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'The error message indicates that the game is trying to access a scenario with the key `\'vendor_talk\'`, which has not been defined in our scenarios dictionary.

Each step should be logged and visible on the console.\n\n### Next Steps\nOnce this is confirmed to be working, we can phase in reading from markdown files for scenarios, add the librarian function to manage the game state more flexibly, and incorporate player dialogue based on the state.\n\nLet me know if you would like to continue down that path or if you have any other requests!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Simulated player chose: explore the city streets\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Simulated player chose: talk to a street vendor\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,524 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam approaches the vendor, who has a variety of exotic foods and gadgets for sale.\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,524 - INFO - Simulated player chose: buy a gadget\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_431d12efa039a37ae7b563c67d144e75.py", line 164, in <module>\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_431d12efa039a37ae7b563c67d144e75.py", line 137, in display_scenario\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\nKeyError: \'buy_gadget\'\nSam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n\nChoices:\n1. explore the city streets\n2. look for a way back to the skyscraper\n3. find a place to eat\n4. other\nSam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n\nChoices:\n1. talk to a street vendor\n2. enter a neon-lit bar\n3. sit on a bench\n4. other\nSam approaches the vendor, who has a variety of exotic foods and gadgets for sale.\n\nChoices:\n1. buy a gadget\n2. ask about the city\n3. say goodbye\n4. other\n', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'stream': False}}

Let\'s start by creating the basic structure of the "Teleport Massive CYOA" text-based adventure game. We\'ll aim to keep the code clean and modular as we build it up step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Setup with Logging\n\nWe\'ll begin by setting up basic logging, defining our game title, and creating a starting scenario for Sam Iker waking from his skyscraper dream.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\n# Logging action\nlogging.info(f"Game started with title: \'{TITLE}\'")\nlogging.info(f"Initial scenario: {start_scenario[\'description\']}")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Logging Setup**: We use Python\'s logging module to enable logging for events in the game. The log will include timestamps, the logging level, and the message.\n\n2. **Game Title**: We define a constant `TITLE` for the game title.\n\n3. **Starting Scenario**: The `start_scenario` dictionary contains a description of the scene and a list of choices available to the player.\n\n4. **Game State**: The `game_state` dictionary holds the current state of the game, including the active scenario, character stats, location, items, and player actions.\n\n5. **Initial Logging**: Upon starting the game, we log the game title and the initial scenario description.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNext, we’ll create a function to display the scenario and handle player choices. We will also start organizing the use of markdown files for the scenarios. Let me know if you want to proceed with that!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': "exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Game started with title: 'Teleport Massive CYOA'\n2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Initial scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n", 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'Great! Now that we have the basic setup and logging working, we\'ll proceed to implement a function to display the current scenario and handle player choices. This function will also incorporate the \'other\' option, allowing players to input their own unique actions.\n\n### Step 2: Display Scenario and Handle Choices\n\nWe\'ll create a function called `display_scenario` which will print the current scenario, present the choices to the player, and handle their input. Here\'s the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do? (Enter the number or write \'Other\' to specify): ")\n\n    # Handle player choice\n    if player_choice.isdigit() and 1 <= int(player_choice) <= len(scenario[\'choices\']):\n        choice_index = int(player_choice) - 1\n        selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n        logging.info(f"Player chose: {selected_choice}")\n        # Here we will handle the choice in the next step\n        return selected_choice\n    elif player_choice.strip().lower() == "other":\n        custom_action = input("You chose \'Other\'. What do you want to do? ")\n        logging.info(f"Player chose a custom action: {custom_action}")\n        return custom_action\n    else:\n        logging.warning("Invalid choice made by the player.")\n        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Function Definition (`display_scenario`)**: This function takes a scenario as input.\n\n2. **Log Scenario Display**: When the scenario is displayed, we log the action.\n\n3. **Print Scenario Description and Choices**: The function prints the scenario description and the available choices with numbers.\n\n4. **Player Input Handling**: \n   - The function checks if the user input is a valid choice (a number corresponding to one of the options).\n   - If the player inputs \'Other\', they have the chance to specify a custom action.\n   - If the input is invalid, a warning is logged, and the function recalls itself recursively to allow the player to try again.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The selected choice or custom action is returned.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe next step will be to handle the selected choice and navigate to a new scenario based on that choice.

To move forward, let\'s refine our approach and ensure that we only break down the code into manageable parts that do not require interactive execution in a limited environment.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nLet’s set up a basic simulation of player choices without needing real-time user inputs. We can define a mock input handling system which simulates player choices while focusing on how to transition between scenarios in a more controlled way.\n\n### Step 3: Simulating Choices with Scenario Navigation\n\nLet\'s enhance the game by adding a hypothetical structure that uses markdown to represent scenarios and transitions based on player choices. This will also formally introduce the idea of handling scenarios from markdown files.\n\n1. We’ll simulate player choices using a defined sequence.\n2. We’ll include functions to read from markdown files later, but for now, we will use static definitions.\n\nHere’s a revised version of the previous code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Sample Scenarios stored within the code for this demonstration\nscenarios = {\n    "start": {\n        "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n        "choices": [\n            "explore the city streets",\n            "look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n            "find a place to eat",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "city_explore",\n            "skyscraper_search",\n            "city_eat",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_explore": {\n        "description": "Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.",\n        "choices": [\n            "talk to a street vendor",\n            "enter a neon-lit bar",\n            "sit on a bench",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "vendor_talk",\n            "bar_entry",\n            "bench_rest",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "skyscraper_search": {\n        "description": "Sam searches for a way back to the skyscraper, feeling a strong desire to fly again.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask a passerby for directions",\n            "search for a taxi",\n            "try to climb the building",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "ask_passersby",\n            "find_taxi",\n            "climb_building",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_eat": {\n        "description": "Sam finds a local diner and enjoys a meal, feeling refreshed and ready for more adventure.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask the waiter for recommendations",\n            "explore the diner further",\n            "leave a good tip",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "waiter_recommend",\n            "diner_explore",\n            "leave_tip",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": "start",\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\ndef display_scenario(scenario_key):\n    # Fetch the scenario from predefined scenarios\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\n    \n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    return scenario\n\n# Simulating player choices - this could be replaced with real input later\ndef simulate_player_choice(scenario):\n    # Just a simple strategy to choose the first option (for demonstration)\n    choice_index = 0  # Simulating the first choice\n    selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n    logging.info(f"Simulated player chose: {selected_choice}")\n    \n    # Find the next scenario based on the choice made\n    next_scenario_key = scenario[\'next_scenarios\'][choice_index]\n    return next_scenario_key\n\n# Game loop simulation\ncurrent_scenario_key = game_state["current_scenario"]\nfor _ in range(5):  # Simulate up to 5 iterations\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n    current_scenario_key = simulate_player_choice(current_scenario)\n\n# Final logging to indicate end of simulation\nlogging.info("Game simulation complete.")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Changes\n\n1. **Scenarios Defined in Code**: All possible scenarios are defined within a dictionary for easy access. In a real implementation, we could later switch this to read from markdown files.\n\n2. **Simulation of Choices**: We added the `simulate_player_choice` function, which simulates player decision-making. For simplicity, it always selects the first choice.\n\n3. **Game Loop Simulation**: We implement a simple loop to simulate several steps in the game, allowing us to see the transitions between scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\nYou can run this full code block now to see how it operates. After we confirm this is working without issues, the next logical step is to implement reading from markdown files for our scenarios, integrating a librarian function to manage the game state, and possibly defining more dynamic player actions. \n\nLet me know how you want to proceed!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: explore the city streets\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: talk to a street vendor\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 118, in <module>\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 91, in display_scenario\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\nKeyError: \'vendor_talk\'\nSam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n\nChoices:\n1. explore the city streets\n2. look for a way back to the skyscraper\n3. find a place to eat\n4. other\nSam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n\nChoices:\n1. talk to a street vendor\n2. enter a neon-lit bar\n3. sit on a bench\n4. other\n', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'The error message indicates that the game is trying to access a scenario with the key `\'vendor_talk\'`, which has not been defined in our scenarios dictionary.

Let\'s start by creating the basic structure of the "Teleport Massive CYOA" text-based adventure game. We\'ll aim to keep the code clean and modular as we build it up step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Setup with Logging\n\nWe\'ll begin by setting up basic logging, defining our game title, and creating a starting scenario for Sam Iker waking from his skyscraper dream.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\n# Logging action\nlogging.info(f"Game started with title: \'{TITLE}\'")\nlogging.info(f"Initial scenario: {start_scenario[\'description\']}")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Logging Setup**: We use Python\'s logging module to enable logging for events in the game. The log will include timestamps, the logging level, and the message.\n\n2. **Game Title**: We define a constant `TITLE` for the game title.\n\n3. **Starting Scenario**: The `start_scenario` dictionary contains a description of the scene and a list of choices available to the player.\n\n4. **Game State**: The `game_state` dictionary holds the current state of the game, including the active scenario, character stats, location, items, and player actions.\n\n5. **Initial Logging**: Upon starting the game, we log the game title and the initial scenario description.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nNext, we’ll create a function to display the scenario and handle player choices. We will also start organizing the use of markdown files for the scenarios. Let me know if you want to proceed with that!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': "exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Game started with title: 'Teleport Massive CYOA'\n2024-11-15 19:35:29,578 - INFO - Initial scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n", 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'Great! Now that we have the basic setup and logging working, we\'ll proceed to implement a function to display the current scenario and handle player choices. This function will also incorporate the \'other\' option, allowing players to input their own unique actions.\n\n### Step 2: Display Scenario and Handle Choices\n\nWe\'ll create a function called `display_scenario` which will print the current scenario, present the choices to the player, and handle their input. Here\'s the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do? (Enter the number or write \'Other\' to specify): ")\n\n    # Handle player choice\n    if player_choice.isdigit() and 1 <= int(player_choice) <= len(scenario[\'choices\']):\n        choice_index = int(player_choice) - 1\n        selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n        logging.info(f"Player chose: {selected_choice}")\n        # Here we will handle the choice in the next step\n        return selected_choice\n    elif player_choice.strip().lower() == "other":\n        custom_action = input("You chose \'Other\'. What do you want to do? ")\n        logging.info(f"Player chose a custom action: {custom_action}")\n        return custom_action\n    else:\n        logging.warning("Invalid choice made by the player.")\n        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Function Definition (`display_scenario`)**: This function takes a scenario as input.\n\n2. **Log Scenario Display**: When the scenario is displayed, we log the action.\n\n3. **Print Scenario Description and Choices**: The function prints the scenario description and the available choices with numbers.\n\n4. **Player Input Handling**: \n   - The function checks if the user input is a valid choice (a number corresponding to one of the options).\n   - If the player inputs \'Other\', they have the chance to specify a custom action.\n   - If the input is invalid, a warning is logged, and the function recalls itself recursively to allow the player to try again.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The selected choice or custom action is returned.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe next step will be to handle the selected choice and navigate to a new scenario based on that choice.

I will also integrate everything so that the game will operate seamlessly from start to finish, giving us a clearer structure. \n\n### Complete Code Structure\n\nHere’s the revised code, which includes everything defined correctly from the start scenario to displaying choices:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Scenario setup\nstart_scenario = {\n    "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n    "choices": [\n        "Explore the city streets",\n        "Look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n        "Find a place to eat",\n        "Other..."\n    ]\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": start_scenario,\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\ndef display_scenario(scenario):\n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    # Get player\'s choice\n    player_choice = input("What do you want to do?

Please try again.")\n        return display_scenario(scenario)\n\n# Call the display function to show the starting scenario\nchoice = display_scenario(start_scenario)\n```\n\n### Key Points\n1. **Organization**: All key components, such as the logging setup, game title, and the starting scenario, are defined in the same code block, ensuring everything is in scope when the program is executed.\n\n2. **Scenario Presentation**: The `display_scenario` function is called at the end, allowing for both the display of information and the capture of player input.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow that the game can display scenarios and accept player input, the next steps are:\n- To define a new scenario based upon choices made.\n- To save scenarios in markdown format and read them into the game.\n\nLet me know if you would like to proceed along this path!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 124 (execution failed)\nCode output: \nTimeout', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'It seems that the execution encountered a timeout error, which can occur for various reasons including the environment not being able to process user inputs properly. To move forward, let\'s refine our approach and ensure that we only break down the code into manageable parts that do not require interactive execution in a limited environment.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\nLet’s set up a basic simulation of player choices without needing real-time user inputs. We can define a mock input handling system which simulates player choices while focusing on how to transition between scenarios in a more controlled way.\n\n### Step 3: Simulating Choices with Scenario Navigation\n\nLet\'s enhance the game by adding a hypothetical structure that uses markdown to represent scenarios and transitions based on player choices. This will also formally introduce the idea of handling scenarios from markdown files.\n\n1. We’ll simulate player choices using a defined sequence.\n2. We’ll include functions to read from markdown files later, but for now, we will use static definitions.\n\nHere’s a revised version of the previous code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\')\n\n# Game title\nTITLE = "Teleport Massive CYOA"\n\n# Sample Scenarios stored within the code for this demonstration\nscenarios = {\n    "start": {\n        "description": "Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.",\n        "choices": [\n            "explore the city streets",\n            "look for a way back to the skyscraper",\n            "find a place to eat",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "city_explore",\n            "skyscraper_search",\n            "city_eat",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_explore": {\n        "description": "Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.",\n        "choices": [\n            "talk to a street vendor",\n            "enter a neon-lit bar",\n            "sit on a bench",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "vendor_talk",\n            "bar_entry",\n            "bench_rest",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "skyscraper_search": {\n        "description": "Sam searches for a way back to the skyscraper, feeling a strong desire to fly again.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask a passerby for directions",\n            "search for a taxi",\n            "try to climb the building",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "ask_passersby",\n            "find_taxi",\n            "climb_building",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n    "city_eat": {\n        "description": "Sam finds a local diner and enjoys a meal, feeling refreshed and ready for more adventure.",\n        "choices": [\n            "ask the waiter for recommendations",\n            "explore the diner further",\n            "leave a good tip",\n            "other"\n        ],\n        "next_scenarios": [\n            "waiter_recommend",\n            "diner_explore",\n            "leave_tip",\n            "custom_action"\n        ]\n    },\n}\n\n# Game state\ngame_state = {\n    "current_scenario": "start",\n    "character_stats": {\n        "name": "Sam Iker",\n        "energy": 100,\n        "happiness": 50\n    },\n    "location": {\n        "name": "Futuristic City",\n        "is_day_time": True\n    },\n    "items": [],\n    "player_actions": []\n}\n\ndef display_scenario(scenario_key):\n    # Fetch the scenario from predefined scenarios\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\n    \n    # Display the scenario description\n    logging.info(f"Displaying scenario: {scenario[\'description\']}")\n    print(scenario[\'description\'])\n\n    # Display choices\n    print("\\nChoices:")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(scenario[\'choices\'], start=1):\n        print(f"{i}. {choice}")  # Display numbered choices\n\n    return scenario\n\n# Simulating player choices - this could be replaced with real input later\ndef simulate_player_choice(scenario):\n    # Just a simple strategy to choose the first option (for demonstration)\n    choice_index = 0  # Simulating the first choice\n    selected_choice = scenario[\'choices\'][choice_index]\n    logging.info(f"Simulated player chose: {selected_choice}")\n    \n    # Find the next scenario based on the choice made\n    next_scenario_key = scenario[\'next_scenarios\'][choice_index]\n    return next_scenario_key\n\n# Game loop simulation\ncurrent_scenario_key = game_state["current_scenario"]\nfor _ in range(5):  # Simulate up to 5 iterations\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n    current_scenario_key = simulate_player_choice(current_scenario)\n\n# Final logging to indicate end of simulation\nlogging.info("Game simulation complete.")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Changes\n\n1. **Scenarios Defined in Code**: All possible scenarios are defined within a dictionary for easy access. In a real implementation, we could later switch this to read from markdown files.\n\n2. **Simulation of Choices**: We added the `simulate_player_choice` function, which simulates player decision-making. For simplicity, it always selects the first choice.\n\n3. **Game Loop Simulation**: We implement a simple loop to simulate several steps in the game, allowing us to see the transitions between scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\nYou can run this full code block now to see how it operates. After we confirm this is working without issues, the next logical step is to implement reading from markdown files for our scenarios, integrating a librarian function to manage the game state, and possibly defining more dynamic player actions. \n\nLet me know how you want to proceed!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: explore the city streets\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n2024-11-15 19:37:05,566 - INFO - Simulated player chose: talk to a street vendor\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 118, in <module>\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_144bc02bd3249628f72117069573672c.py", line 91, in display_scenario\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\nKeyError: \'vendor_talk\'\nSam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n\nChoices:\n1. explore the city streets\n2. look for a way back to the skyscraper\n3. find a place to eat\n4. other\nSam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n\nChoices:\n1. talk to a street vendor\n2. enter a neon-lit bar\n3. sit on a bench\n4. other\n', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'The error message indicates that the game is trying to access a scenario with the key `\'vendor_talk\'`, which has not been defined in our scenarios dictionary.

Each step should be logged and visible on the console.\n\n### Next Steps\nOnce this is confirmed to be working, we can phase in reading from markdown files for scenarios, add the librarian function to manage the game state more flexibly, and incorporate player dialogue based on the state.\n\nLet me know if you would like to continue down that path or if you have any other requests!', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\nCode output: 2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Simulated player chose: explore the city streets\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,523 - INFO - Simulated player chose: talk to a street vendor\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,524 - INFO - Displaying scenario: Sam approaches the vendor, who has a variety of exotic foods and gadgets for sale.\n2024-11-15 19:37:24,524 - INFO - Simulated player chose: buy a gadget\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_431d12efa039a37ae7b563c67d144e75.py", line 164, in <module>\n    current_scenario = display_scenario(current_scenario_key)\n  File "/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/teleport-massive/cyoa/coding/tmp_code_431d12efa039a37ae7b563c67d144e75.py", line 137, in display_scenario\n    scenario = scenarios[scenario_key]\nKeyError: \'buy_gadget\'\nSam Iker wakes up in a futuristic city, still feeling the sensation of flying around a skyscraper.\n\nChoices:\n1. explore the city streets\n2. look for a way back to the skyscraper\n3. find a place to eat\n4. other\nSam explores the bustling city streets, filled with strange and advanced technology.\n\nChoices:\n1. talk to a street vendor\n2. enter a neon-lit bar\n3. sit on a bench\n4. other\nSam approaches the vendor, who has a variety of exotic foods and gadgets for sale.\n\nChoices:\n1. buy a gadget\n2. ask about the city\n3. say goodbye\n4. other\n', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'user_proxy'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'stream': False}}
